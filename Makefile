# Notes from template:
# () Each command in the makefile must be a single line, and each command is run in a separate shell. Newer versions
# of make (than we currently Â have) support .ONESHELL where it will reuse the shell. Since we are getting a separate shell,
# if we're using venvs we need to re-source the activation each time.
# 
# () We need to upgrade pip because of a bug where Big Sur Macos reports a different major version for the OS, which makes the old
# pip not use the whl file and instead build from a tar which takes forever. Make sure this happens before installing the other deps
# 
# () Installing the requirements for the app and the tests are not strictly required, as tox will install them in its venv if they
# aren't already there. However, they are a convenience for developers so they can point their IDE at a complete venv.

# Create the Makefile
# Create a file called Makefile (no extension) in the root directory. This file will contain commands that can be run locally to automate dev/test workflows. In addition, this Makefile will be used during the Jenkins build pipeline. Specifically, the Jenkins pipeline will run make build followed by make package.
# Copy and paste the following code into your Makefile. 
# Make sure to update <SAM_ARFIFACT_NAME> with the same artifact name you used in the template.yaml file (CHOICE_IAM_<LAMBA_NAME>).
